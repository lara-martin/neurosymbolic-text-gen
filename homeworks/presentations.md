=============================================================

This assignment is to measure your ability to...
* critically read academic papers
* apply techniques and methods mentioned in the paper to other scenarios

# Instructions

Once you are assigned a paper, you will be told the approximate date when your presentation will be. (Since the lecture material moves around as the course progresses, the presentation dates might move as well.)

Your presentation should be about 8 minutes long + a few minutes for questions.

Your talk should include:
- a summary of the paper,
- what the strengths of the paper are, and
- what the weaknesses of the paper are

# Rubric

| Criteria | Possible Points| Description|
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
|Summary| 4 points | High-level summary that explains the key points of the paper without going into unnecessary detail, but explains concepts that might be unknown to the class |
| Strengths | 4 points | A few strengths of the paper compared to other work in the field|
|Weaknesses | 4 points | A few weaknesses of the paper compared to other work in the field|=
|Length | 1 point | Presentation is less than or equal to 8 minutes long |
|Slides| 3 points| Slides are organized/look professional, not overly wordy, and not just copying text from the paper|


## What to submit

1. <a href="{{page.submission_link}}">A Powerpoint (ppt or pptx) file or a link to where we can find the slides online (e.g., Google Slides).</a>
